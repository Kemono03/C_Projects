						ALARM CLOCK


Download any .wav file and name it "alarm" in lowercaps to use it as the alarm,
it should stay in the same folder as the .exe file itself, you can create a .exe desktop shortcut if wish so.
If you would you like to change anything you can do so in the alarmclock.c file.

NOTE: IF YOUR FILE ISNT .WAV YOU CAN USE AN ONLINE CONVERTOR TO CONVERT YOUR FILE TYPE TO .WAV
