						Ceaser's Chipher

These programs allow you to encode, decode and brutforce a message using the shift method where the program
shifts (x) letters in the alphabet to scrable it, making it unreadable.

Caesar cipher is a basic letters substitution algorithm. It takes a message and applys to every letter
a particular shift. This shift used to be 3 (Caesar shift), according to history, when it was used by Caesar 
to encrypt war messages. Of course you can choose any shift you want. the problem of this cipher is that its
really poor security. To break it, you can, like I do here, apply every shift to the cipher, and see if
there's one that makes sense.
